    <h3>condition</h3>
    <p>An expression whose value is used as a condition.</p>
    <h3>exprIfTrue</h3>
    <p>An expression which is executed if the condition evaluates to a truthy value (one which equals or can be
        converted to true).</p>
    <h3>exprIfFalse</h3>
    <p>An expression which is executed if the condition is falsy (that is, has a value which can be converted to false).
    </p>
    <h3>String interpolation</h3>
    <p>String interpolation is replacing placeholders with values in a string literal. The string interpolation in
        JavaScript is performed by template literals (strings wrapped in backticks `) and ${expression} as a
        placeholder.</p>
