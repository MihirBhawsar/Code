        <h1>The CSS Box Model</h1>
        <p>
          In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and
          layout. <br />
          CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML
          element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual
          content. The image below illustrates the box model:
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box2">
        <h1>Explanation of the different parts:</h1>
        <p>
          Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear <br />
          Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is
          transparent <br />
          - A border that goes around the padding and content <br />
          Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent
        </p>
        <h2>
          The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define
          space between elements.
        </h2>
      </div>
      <div class="box3">
        <h1>Width and Height of an Element</h1>
        <p>
          In order to set the width and height of an element correctly in all
          browsers, you need to know how the box model works.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
          <strong>Important:</strong> When you set the width and height
          properties of an element with CSS, you just set the width and height
          of the <strong>content area.</strong> To calculate the full size of an
          element, you must also add padding, borders and margins.
