        The more contributions fundraisers bring in, the bigger the impact. And
        today, it’s easier than ever to donate to a charity or a non-profit
        organization. In fact, since Facebook launched fundraising tools in
        2015, fundraisers have raised over $2 billion for nonprofits through the
        social media platform. With that in mind, securing donations for a
        fundraiser is still easier said than done.

        Even if you have a charity with a great mission, there’s a lot of
        competition out there for causes. But the right slogan that touches the
        hearts and minds of contributors, can transform a campaign into a life
        changer for the recipients of a cause.
